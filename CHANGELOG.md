# Changelog

## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- Gas last reading date sensor exposing the recording date from the latest cumulative reading.

### Changed
- Electricity last reading sensors renamed to highlight daily aggregation and align the entity titles with the data returned by Kraken.
- Added or refreshed explicit icons across all exposed entities to deliver consistent visuals in Home Assistant dashboards.

### Breaking

### Documentation
- Updated README files to document the renamed electricity sensors and the new gas reading date entity.
